# Surfs up Analysis
My analysis on the Surfs up Data.

# Overview of Project
	The data provided to me in one file, represent a raw information of surfs up Company. 

# Purpose
To help W.Avy to simply understand the provided data and giving him elements to make the right decision on opening a surf shop in Oahu.
# Analysis and Challenges
Many database functions did not work well when running my code until     I have updated my material version and importing dependencies.


# Results
•	The minimum temperature for the month of June is 64f, and 56F for the month of December.
•	The average temperature for the month of June is 75f, and 71F for the month of December. 
•	The maximum temperature for the month of June is 85f, and 83F for the month of December.

# Summary
I do not have access to see where W.Avy wants to install his new shop, and he should check for the following:
•	Gather data on airlines fill rate.
•	Gather data on hotels fill rate.
•	Run the same code for the years preceding 2017 for the same months of June and December, then plot the results into a line chart to see the evolution and the change of temperature.
